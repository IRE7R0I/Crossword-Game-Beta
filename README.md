 Crossword Game Beta Developed In C++

It consists of a map of the crossword created with the vector library (as if it were an arraylist), together with the words, which I developed as structured data (similar to classes in java). The game works with any crossword puzzle mapping the words that are required.

The game starts and asks what orientation you want to choose (H/Horizontal or V/Vertical) by selecting said character it asks for the id of the word that is required and then when it is guessed, the word is deleted.

The game ends when the arraylist(of words) runs out of words!
